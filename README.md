# LambdaTester
Test Generation for Higher-Order Functions in Dynamic Languages

## Requirements

## Test Generation
To generate tests use the following command:

`node testGeneration.js <function names> <number of tests> <setup code> <is feedback directed> <callback type> <include dynamic analysis> <testFolder> <polyfills to analyze (optional)>`


Explanation of required inputs:


    - function names: names of methods under test (e.g., reduce)
    - number of tests: number of tests to be generated
    - setup code: file containing setup code. To test array methods use setupCode/setupArray.js and to test promise methods use setupCode/setupPromise.js 
    - is feedback directed: indicates whether callback position inference and the feedback are part of test generation (0 – no, 1 – yes). To generate tests with Base approach choose 0.
    - callback type: 
         0 - empty callback (Cb-Empty approach)
         1 - callback generated by quickcheck (Cb-Quick approach) 
         2 - use mined callbacks (Cb-Mined approach)
         3 - use callbacks generated based on dynamic analysis of memory reads (Cb-Writes approach)
    - run with dynamic analysis: indicates whether the dynamic analysis of memory reads is used during test generation (0 – no, 1 – yes)
    - test folder: a path to a folder to put generated tests
    - polyfills to analyze (optional): This is an optional input and should be specified only if the test generator uses dynamic analysis for callback generation. Specifies paths to polyfills that are dynamically analyzed.

Examples:

- To generate 10 tests for reduce array method with Base approach (no feedback, no inference of callback positons):

`node testGeneration.js 'reduce' 10 ./setupCode/setupArray.js 0 0 0 reduceTests`

- To generate 10 tests for then promise method with Cb-Empty approach (feedback-directed, empty callbacks):

`node testGeneration.js 'then' 10 ./setupCode/setupPromise.js 1 0 0 thenTests`

3. To generate 10 tests for map array method with Cb-Quick approach (feedback-directed, callbacks generated by QuickCheck):

`node testGeneration.js 'map' 10 ./setupCode/setupArray.js 1 1 0 mapTests`

4. To generate 10 tests for some array method with Cb-Mined approach (feedback-directed, mined callbacks):

`node testGeneration.js 'some' 10 ./setupCode/setupArray.js 1 2 0 someTests`

5. To generate 10 tests for filter array method with Cb-Writes approach (feedback-directed, callbacks with targeted writes) and by analyzing the polyfill from mozilla library:

`node testGeneration.js 'filter' 10 ./setupCode/setupArray.js 1 3 1 filterTests './polyfills/filter/mozilla.js'`

## Differential Testing

When comparing the behavior of polyfills and native implementation, LambdaTester differentiates between several behavioral differences (Section 6.3). The output of differential testing shows how many tests expose differences in Error messages, Warning messages, Standard outputs, Receiver objects, Return objects and Callback arguments.
