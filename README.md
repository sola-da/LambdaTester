Test Generation for Higher-Order Functions in Dynamic Languages

## Test Generation
To generate tests run the following command:

`node testGeneration.js <function names> <number of tests> <setup code> <is feedback directed> <callback type> <include dynamic analysis> <testFolder> <polyfills to analyze (optional)>`


Explanation of required inputs:


    - function names: names of methods under test (e.g., reduce)
    - number of tests: number of tests to be generated
    - setup code: file containing setup code. To test array methods use setupCode/setupArray.js and to test promise methods use setupCode/setupPromise.js 
    - is feedback directed: indicates whether callback position inference and the feedback are part of test generation (0 – no, 1 – yes). To generate tests with Base approach choose 0.
    • callback type: 
        - 0 - empty callback (Cb-Empty approach)
        - 1 - callback generated by quickcheck (Cb-Quick approach) 
        - 2 - use mined callbacks (Cb-Mined approach)
        - 3 - use callbacks generated based on dynamic analysis of memory reads (Cb-Writes approach)
    - run with dynamic analysis: indicates whether the dynamic analysis of memory reads is used during test generation (0 – no, 1 – yes)
    - test folder: a path to a folder to put generated tests
    - polyfills to analyze (optional): This is an optional input and should be specified only if the test generator uses dynamic analysis for callback generation. Specifies paths to polyfills that are dynamically analyzed.
